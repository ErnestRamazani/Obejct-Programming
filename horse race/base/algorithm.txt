Algorithm 

We will need only one function + the main function
We will first import all the necessary libraries 
We create our global variables 
The globals variables are 5 arrays containing the position of each horse and the 15 units 
we create our first function
the fuction will have one loop with 5 different index for the 5 different horses 
we create 5 variables that contains the flip coin random generator 
for each variable, we have one index so that we can use it to swap the char in the array
if the coin flipped gives an 1, we swap the index with the closest char 
if flip gives an 0, we do nothing but still print the position of the index so we know which horse is leading 
we increaming all index by one and set a limit so the loop does not go for ever 
the first to reach the limit won.
