Our hero, a brave and determined warrior, lives in a peaceful village nestled in the heart of the kingdom. Trained by the village elder, the hero has honed three unique skills over time - Cooking, Woodworking, and Singing. These skills, while valuable in village life, are not particularly useful when it comes to facing fiery beasts such as the Phoenix.

Despite this, the hero is unfazed. He knows that his journey will be fraught with danger, and yet he is prepared to face it. With 25 life points and a small pouch containing 30 gold pieces (earned from his 3 skills), he is ready to venture into the unknown, battle the mighty Phoenix, and rescue the captive baby.

Will you, as the hero, choose to spend your gold on more life or on upscaling your skills to increase your power? The choice is yours, and the fate of the baby hangs in the balance.

Arriving at the market, you survey your options. There are items to boost your life, and there are skills to learn, each promising to strengthen you in your upcoming battle against the Phoenix.

For every 10 gold pieces, you can buy 20% of your life back. And you can sell your skills for 10 gold pieces, unless they're worth less - in that case, you'll have to sell them for their purchase price.

The skills available are as follows:

1. Flame Flicker - 7 gold pieces (Combat Level 5)
2. Wind Whip- 7 gold pieces (Combat Level 5)
3. Stone Shatter - 7 gold pieces (Combat Level 5)
4. Water Wisp - 7 gold pieces (Combat Level 5)
5. Light Lash - 7 gold pieces (Combat Level 5)
6. Thunder Thrust- 15 gold pieces (Combat Level 10)
7. Earth Eruption - 20 gold pieces (Combat Level 17)
8. Tidal Tsunami - 25 gold pieces (Combat Level 22)
9. Blazing Burst- 30 gold pieces (Combat Level 25)
10. Celestial Cataclysm - 50 gold pieces (Combat Level 40)

You must decide wisely, as your choices could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

Congratulations, you have defeated the Phoenix! Its flaming body lies defeated before you. But as you step over its body to reach the baby, a burning tail feather breaks off and falls towards you and the baby.

You only have time to save one of you. Will it be you, the last warrior of the village, or the baby, the future of the village?

In a moment of selfless bravery, you throw yourself over the baby, shielding it from the falling tail feather. The feather lands on you, its fiery heat too much to bear. As your vision fades, you see the baby, safe and unharmed, crawling away from you. You have saved the future of your village.

With a heavy heart, you roll away from the baby, the tail feather landing where you were just a moment ago. The heat is intense, but you are safe. As you rise, you see the baby, its small body caught in the fire. You are filled with regret, but you know that the village still needs its warrior. You are that warrior.
